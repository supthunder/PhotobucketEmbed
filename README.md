# Why?
ebay will remove live content mid 2017, photobucket's album embed will not work

# What does it do?
It grabs links to all photos in an album, and creates an embed link for each photo

# How to use:
1. Create an album in photobucket, not how many pages it creates
2. get the link and add it to the code, add page #'s
3. Run the script, and check embed.html for the code
4. Copy paste the code into ebay and you have all photos in your listing

# future 
- add all these photos to a html5 album
- take out the need for page numbers
- take out need to manually change code
